# Find number of subsets
# given a set of integers and an integer s, does any non-empty subset sum to s


#You must find number of subsets of an array where the largest number is the sum of the remaining numbers.For example, for an input of:

# 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
# the subsets would be
# 1 + 2 = 3
# 1 + 3 = 4
# 2 + 4 = 6
# 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
# Here is the list of numbers you should run your code on. In the above case the answer would be 4.
# 3, 4, 9, 14, 15, 19, 28, 37, 47, 50, 54, 56, 59, 61, 70, 73, 78, 81, 92, 95, 97, 99
